My name is Jason Anton.  I'm a software and web developer.  Over the course of my career I've made things that people use and a lot more things that nobody has ever used.  I also play drums.  A few people have herd me play drums but a lot more people haven't.

The purpose of this website is two-fold:

1.  Learn to use jekyll
2.  Share stuff sometimes

I also will share, on occasion, other projects I'm working on and things I've learned while working on them.  Here are some of the things I'm working on now:

*  [courtneyanton.com](http://courtneyanton.com "Courtney Anton Photography")
*  [expressionstributes.com](http://expressionstributes.com "Expressions Tributes")

Feel free to contact me via the methods listed in the footer below.  Thanks for visiting my site.

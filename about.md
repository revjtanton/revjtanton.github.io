My name is Jason Anton.  I'm a software and web developer.  Over the course of my career I've made things that people use and a lot more things that nobody has ever used.  I also play drums.  A few people have herd me play drums but a lot more people haven't.

The purpose of this website is two-fold:
<ol>
  <li>Learn to use jekyll.</li>
  <li>Share stuff sometimes.</li>
</ol>

I also will share, on occasion, other projects I'm working on and things I've learned while working on them.  Here are some of the things I'm working on now:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://courtneyanton.com">courtneyanton.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://expressionstributes.com">expressionstributes.com</a></li>
</ul>

Feel free to contact me via the methods listed in the footer below.  Thanks for visiting my site.

*    Developed insurance software using LAMP, RESTful, and MVC and object oriented principals.   The system relied on an object oriented database structure of my design and RESTful calls to facilitate a “headless” backend service that could be used by any front-end GUI.   
*    Wrote detailed documentation about the custom framework for the insurance software. 
*    Traveled to the country of Mali in Africa to investigate business opportunities in the cyber security sector with their government.  I met with leaders of that nation to discuss cyber security. 
*    Created a Drupal multi-site platform using the open source project Aegir that could spot deploy sites using a custom profile.  This will be used to sell and manage websites for upwards of 500 or more funeral homes.

*    Created business critical analytical reports using SQL Server and SQL Server Report Manager 
*    Developed a Quickbooks “bridge” between systems.  This bridge was capable of taking updated data from Quickbooks and updating a parent system using ODBC, but it was also capable of finding updates on the parent system and updating Quickbooks.  Using a two way validation script I developed, the system was able to establish which system was more current, and keep both systems in-line with each other. 
*    Developed a content management system framework from the ground up using PHP, MySQL, and Apache.  I was responsible for the design of the framework, development of modules within the framework, management of the framework, and leading the team of developers.  Using an Object Oriented Database design we were able to create a system of anything to anything associations.  In this system any data set was considered an object, and any object could associate to any other object at any time or at any place within the system.  Using RESTful calls to other modules the code was extremely dynamic and reusable.

*    Developed a mobile application for publications using Sencha Touch 2.  This application was to take an online publication (Drupal), parse it for use in a mobile app, and provide functions like user authentication, and offline access. 
*    Involvement with a large scale migration project for a major utility publication.  My involvement was migrating over 3000 legacy Cold Fusion articles in poorly formatted HTML into a Drupal 7 environment dynamically.  My work involved parsing the HTML looking for patterns as defined by regular expression, then dumping that parsed document into a custom SQL table for reference.  I then created a boot-strap application in Drupal to read the SQL and put the nodes in Drupal. 
*    Work was done on various other projects relating to Drupal 7, migrations, and integration.

*    Developed an Object-Oriented Database application within the Joomla framework using MySQL custom functions and procedures as well as custom PHP code that adhered to Joomla's Model View Controller framework.  The application was designed to be able to compare any like parsable file with any other like parseable file.  Currently it is being used to compare McAfee EPO Anti-virus configuration exports with an expert baseline export.   The application can compare like and non-like values, however for the EPO example it only compares like values.    
*    Created components, modules, and plugins for Joomla 1.6.  My work here has been extensive and complicated.

Hey Jekyll.  Wow!  I like it.  Simple to write posts, simple to setup.  I am no front-end person, I have no understanding of prettiness on webpages, so this site will stay basic.  If I ever post another blog here then I can use syntax highlighting like this:

{% highlight php %}
<?php echo 'hey buddy!' ?>
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty simple.  Jekyll seems easy to use.  Fantastic.

Check this out: [VR Camden Yards](http://www.jasonanton.com/vr_pages/opening-day.html "VR Camden Yards").  This is a VR panorama of opening day 2015 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.  It was taken after the game close to the field.  This is best viewed with [Google Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/ "Google Cardboard") and is using [WebVR](https://github.com/povdocs/webvr-starter-kit/ "WebVR")

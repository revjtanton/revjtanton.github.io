So I was messing around with some stuff and stumbled upon an old video I took for my wife's father a long time ago.  This video was taken while my wife's father was in the hospital terminally ill with a heart condition.  He was responding to the kid's laughter, but the hospital policy was preventing the girls from seeing him personally.  We made a video for my wife to play for him at his bedside, and I threw it in an S3 bucket to get it to her easily.  So, though the video is silly, I think it was a fine discovery from the archives!  

I didn't want to just throw it on YouTube, but instead mess with HTML5 video players and put it on the site directly.  It's been a while since I messed with any.  I had some experience with Sublime, but they've apparently moved on.  So this is a Video.JS test.  I'm not optimizing this video for web or anything, it is as it's found so it is large and may take a while to stream.  Likewise I'm just throwing the plain vanilla Video.JS embedd code on here to see how I like the player.  If I like it I'll download it and putt'er into Jekyll.  Anyway, enjoy!

Hey Jekyll.  Wow!  I like it.  Simple to write posts, simple to setup.  I am no front-end person, I have no understanding of prettiness on webpages, so this site will stay basic.  If I ever post another blog here then I can use syntax highlighting like this:

{% highlight php %}
<?php echo 'hey buddy!' ?>
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty simple.  Jekyll seems easy to use.  Fantastic.
